# RTL-SDR Setup Overview

## What is RTL-SDR?

RTL-SDR (Software Defined Radio) is a low-cost USB dongle that can receive a wide range of radio signals â€” such as AM/FM, aircraft transponders (ADS-B), weather satellites, and more. Originally made for DVB-T TV, it has become a powerful tool for RF experimentation.

## Why I Explored This

As part of my hands-on networking and RF learning lab, I decided to experiment with RTL-SDR to:
- Learn how RF signals are captured and visualized
- Practice tuning into local broadcast stations
- Understand software-defined radio architecture
- Get familiar with real-world signal environments using affordable hardware

This project is part of my ongoing practical portfolio in IT, networking, and RF tech.

SETUP:
Hardware used:
- RTL-SDR USB Dongle
- Small Antenna
- USB 3.0 Port on Windows Computer to plug the dongle in

Software Used:
- Installed Zadig Software (Used to install the drivers to detect the SDR device)
- Installed SDR Sharp (GUI spectrum analyzer to tune signals)

Outcome:
Setup was succesful, I was able to connect my device and drivers and was able to manually configure the antenna to tune into live local frequencies and analyze the RF signals

I have found that the more notable and stronger signals around me were in particular the radio signals such as 107.100 and 100.200, etc, a stronger antenna / better placement would increase signal strength and tune more into further signals.
I have also observed UHF burst signals from the airplane channels such as 200.100, these may possibly IoT or Sensors. In the future I would definately like to experiment with similar / stronger equipment and see how those devices work.
