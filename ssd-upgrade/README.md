SSD Upgrade Overview

I've bought a CRUCIAL P3 2TB SSD memory module in order to increase my storage and speeds up to 3200Mhz support by:
- Installing a new SSD with max speeds compatible with my motherboard
- Adding a 2TB Crucial P3 NVMe SSD into m.2 slot
- Configuring Dual boot with windows for this new SSD

Why Did I do it?

This upgrade supports my lab work and future goals such as:
- Running Virtual Machines more efficiently
- Handling SDR software, compliers and various AI tools
- Practicing OS Installation, bootloader config and file system management

This is part of my personal tech lab and practical IT journey (upgrading from current 16GB to 64GB RAM next for future goals)

Installation Process:

- Created a bootable USB using Windows Media Creation tool
- Powered off the PC and unplugged it
- Opened side panel by removing screws by hand
- Located the M.2 Slot and inserted my new SSD
- Booted into BIOS
- Launched Installed and created partitions on the crucial SSD

  Result:
  I now have an additional 2TB SSD memory in my system with the option to dual boot
